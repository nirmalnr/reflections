What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This creates a new git repository using the current directory the user is in. 
No commits would be made and the if any files are present they would be untracked.
git status can be used to check this.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area - Collection of things which will be moved to repository as part of next commit.
Working directory - The directory in which we are aking our changes.
Repository - All snapshots of commits are stored.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only add the files that we want to commit to the staging area and commit with appropriate comment.
Then add the changes for the next logical change to it and commit.
